"""The two Qwen2-Audio calls of a turn (same server, port 8000):

1. hear    : user audio -> {"heard": "..."}   (JSON-constrained so the transcript comes back clean, ~150-300 ms)
2. planner : transcript + conversation -> {"for_me", "do", "say"}   (text only, schema-constrained, few-shot)

Measured on DGX3: the split is far more reliable than asking for everything from the audio in one call (that version
claimed actions without doing them, answered news from memory and replied to the TV). Order inside the planner JSON:
for_me (stop early if not for FDA) -> say (streams into TTS at once) -> do. Measured on 23 test sentences: say-first
21/23 correct with the first word after ~135 ms; do-first 20/23 after ~330 ms (cfg.planner_say_first).

- Timeless general knowledge, stories, jokes, advice, chit-chat: just answer in say, briefly (2-3 sentences).
