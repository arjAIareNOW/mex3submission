"""Pipecat processors that give the agent FDA's full-duplex manners.

DuplexGuard     the user starts talking while the bot talks -> duck the voice at once (no talking over each other),
                then: a backchannel ("uh huh", "okay") or a short noise -> back to full volume, keep talking;
                a real interruption (>= 3 words, or long sustained speech) -> stop (Pipecat interruption).
NotForMe        the LLM answers "(silent)" for speech that is not meant for it (people talking to each other, TV,
                a phone call): nothing is spoken. If that speech had interrupted the bot, it resumes what it was
                saying instead of going quiet.
UiTap           mirrors what was heard and said to the display.
