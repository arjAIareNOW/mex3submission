"""Offline QA for Elkit: no LLM, no internet, no tokens, no mic, no servers. Runs in a few seconds.

    ..\\.venv\\Scripts\\python tests\\qa_offline.py              # every check
    ..\\.venv\\Scripts\\python tests\\qa_offline.py -k voice      # only sections whose name has "voice"
    ..\\.venv\\Scripts\\python tests\\qa_offline.py --replay      # also: your real logs through today's code

What it checks (everything that does not need the model):
    voice       what is said aloud: links, emoji, odd Unicode, pesos, "(no further response)", filler
    thinking    leaked reasoning ("The user wants ...") and dot garbage are caught, real replies are not
    stop        bare "stop", "continue", video commands, the agent's name
    rules       backchannels, side talk, fast-path room commands, evidence for a tool
    room        reminders (add / edit / delete), alarms (set / cancel), timers, lights, thermostat
    replies     the reply filter: (silent), thinking aloud, garbage, repeats, resuming after a cut-in
    tabs        Interface sub-tabs by voice: names, switching, closing, room / interface
    video       video by voice: pause, louder, volume 30, skip, close, photos next
    app         hands-free app use: go to contact, scroll, press space, click send
    tweak       live changes by voice: flip the bird, make it blue
    history     the conversation sent to the LLM: leaked reasoning and broken tool calls removed
    tools       every tool has a schema, required fields exist, the display's JavaScript parses

--replay reads logs/agent.log (what was heard) and logs/mcp-tts.log (what was said) and shows what today's code
does with each line: which heard lines never reach the LLM (stop, ignored, direct action) and which spoken lines
would now be cut or changed. Nothing is sent anywhere.
